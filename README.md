#QUnit Seed

## Intro

This is a basic QUnit Seed to help one to get going with QUnit

It contains one Javascript Object in ```utility.js``` and a tests for it in ```utility_test.js```

To run the tests open the ```test-setup.html``` file in a browser.

##Run tests from the terminal

You can run your QUnit tests from the terminal using gulp.

Gulp is a build tool for Javascript (@dave w - thinkSBT), http://gulpjs.com/, to run it one need node & npm installed.

To install gulp, execute this command in the terminal:

```npm install -g gulp```

In the QUnitSeed folder you need to execute the command below to install the plugins gulp needs:

```npm install```

After this you should be able to do ```gulp test``` from the terminal in the QUnitSeed folder.
